# Project Title: Temperature Anomaly Detection for Device Failure Prediction

## Introduction
This project analyzes temperature time series data to detect anomalies that may indicate potential device failure. The goal is to identify unusual temperature patterns that could serve as early warning signs of device malfunction, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is a time series dataset containing temperature readings. It includes a timestamp and a temperature value. The dataset was obtained from [mention the source if possible, otherwise state that it's a provided dataset].

## Problem Statement
The primary problem addressed is the identification of abnormal temperature readings within the time series data. These anomalies are hypothesized to be indicators of potential device failure. The project aims to categorize these anomalies based on time of day and day of the week to understand if certain periods are more prone to unusual temperature fluctuations.

## Methodology
The approach involves several steps:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the temperature data and examining its structure and characteristics.
2. **Time Series Visualization:** Plotting the temperature data over time to observe trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to categorize data by time of day (Day/Night) and day of the week (Weekday/Weekend).
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Applying two different anomaly detection algorithms:
    - **Elliptic Envelope:** Assuming the normal data follows a Gaussian distribution.
    - **Isolation Forest:** An ensemble method that isolates anomalies based on random partitioning.
5. **Visualization and Analysis of Anomalies:** Visualizing the detected anomalies for each category and comparing the results from both algorithms.
6. **Counting Anomalies:** Quantifying the number of anomalies detected in each category.

## Results
